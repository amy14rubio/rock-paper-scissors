# Rock Paper Scissors CLI Game

An interactive command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game featuring fun ASCII art animations. Players can challenge the computer, track their performance, and enjoy a smooth, engaging gameplay loop. The application uses a class-based design to separate game logic from user interaction and manages flow using callbacks.

## Gameplay Experience

Jump right into the game through an interactive menu:

1. Play a round of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer
2. View detailed game statistics (wins, losses, ties, win rate)
3. Exit anytime

Each round features an animated ASCII countdown before revealing both choices and the result. After each round, players are seamlessly returned to the main menu to continue playing.
